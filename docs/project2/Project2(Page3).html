<p>Once upon a time, a very long time ago now, about last Friday, Winnie-the-Pooh lived in a forest all by himself under the name of Sanders.</p>
<p>("What does 'under the name' mean?" asked Christopher Robin.</p>
<p>"It means he had the name over the door in gold letters, and lived under it."</p>
<p>"Winnie-the-Pooh wasn't quite sure," said Christopher Robin.</p>
<p>"Now I am," said a growly voice.</p>
<p>"Then I will go on," said I.)</p>
<p>One day when he was out walking, he came to an open place in the middle of the forest, and in the middle of this place was a large oak-tree, and, from the top of the tree, there came a loud buzzing-noise.</p>
<p>Winnie-the-Pooh sat down at the foot of the tree, put his head between his paws and began to think.</p>
<img src = "images/pooh2.png" alt = "Winnie the Pooh thinking and sitting" id = "image1">
<p>First of all he said to himself: "That buzzing-noise means something. You don't get a buzzing-noise like that, just buzzing and buzzing, without its meaning something.</p>
<p>If there's a buzzing-noise, somebody's making a buzzing-noise, and the only reason for making a buzzing-noise that I know of is because you're a bee.</p>
<p>Then he thought another long time, and said:</p>
<p>"And the only reason for being a bee that <br>I know of is making honey."</p>
<p>And then he got up, and said: "And the only reason for making honey is so as I can eat it."<br> So he began to climb the tree.</p>
<p>He climbed and he climbed and he climbed, and as he climbed he sang a little song to himself. It went like this:<br>
Isn't it funny<br>
How a bear likes honey?<br>
Buzz! Buzz! Buzz!<br>
I wonder why he does?</p>
<p>Then he climbed a little further ... and a little further ... and then just a little further. By that time he had thought of another song.</p>
<p>It's a very funny thought that, if Bears were Bees, They'd build their nests at the bottom of trees.</p>
<p>And that being so (if the Bees were Bears),
We shouldn't have to climb up all these stairs.</p>
<p>He was getting rather tired by this time, so that is why he sang a Complaining Song. </p>
<p>He was nearly there now, and if he just stood on that branch ...</p>
<img src = "images/pooh5.png" alt = "Winnie the Pooh falling from the tree" id = "image2">
	
<u><strong><p>Crack!</p></strong></u>

<p>"Oh, help!" said Pooh, as he dropped ten feet on the branch below him.</p>
<p>"If only I hadn't——" he said, as he bounced twenty feet on to the next branch.</p>
<p>"You see, what I meant to do," he explained, as he turned head-over-heels, and crashed on to another branch thirty feet below, "what I meant to do——"</p>
<p>"Of course, it was rather——" he admitted, as he slithered very quickly through the next six branches.</p>
<p>"It all comes, I suppose," he decided, as he said good-bye to the last branch, spun round three times, and flew gracefully into a gorse-bush, "it all comes of liking honey so much. Oh, help!"</p>
<br>
