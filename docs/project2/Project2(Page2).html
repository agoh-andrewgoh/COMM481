<p>Here is Edward Bear, coming downstairs now, bump, bump, bump, on the back of his head, behind Christopher Robin.</p>
<p>It is, as far as he knows, the only way of coming downstairs, but sometimes he feels that there really is another way, if only he could stop bumping for a moment and think of it.</p>
<p>And then he feels that perhaps there isn't. Anyhow, here he is at the bottom, and ready to be introduced to you. Winnie-the-Pooh.</p>
<p>When I first heard his name, I said, just as you are going to say, "But I thought he was a boy?"</p>
<img src = "images/pooh1.png" alt = "Christopher Robin holding pooh bear" class = "image">
<p>"So did I," said Christopher Robin.</p>
<p>"Then you can't call him Winnie?"</p><p>"I don't."</p>
<p>"But you said——"</p>
<p>"He's Winnie-ther-Pooh. Don't you know what 'ther' means?"</p>	
<p>"Ah, yes, now I do," I said quickly; and I hope you do too, because it is all the explanation you are going to get.</p>
<p>Sometimes Winnie-the-Pooh likes a game of some sort when he comes downstairs, and sometimes he likes to sit quietly in front of the fire and listen to a story. This evening——</p>
<p>"What about a story?" said Christopher Robin.</p>
<p>"What about a story?" I said.</p>
<p>"Could you very sweetly tell Winnie-the-Pooh one?"</p>
<p>"I suppose I could," I said. "What sort of stories does he like?"</p>
<p>"About himself. Because he's that sort of Bear."</p>
<p>"Oh, I see."</p>
<p>"So could you very sweetly?"</p>
<p>"I'll try," I said.</p>
<p>So I tried.</p>
